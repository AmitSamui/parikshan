# PARIKSHAN

**Parikshan** is a decentralized application (DApp) built on the blockchain that enables secure and transparent verification of certificates and credentials. The system leverages **blockchain technology** and **IPFS (InterPlanetary File System)** to ensure the integrity and immutability of certificate records.



## Features

### 1. Add Issuer

### Truffle and IPFS (Inter Planetary File System)
1.  Configure Blockchain and IPFS: Set up the appropriate configurations for your chosen blockchain platform and IPFS node.
2. For IPFS configuration , go to [Infura website](https://app.infura.io/) , create an account and generate the IPFS **project api key** and **api secret key** and save them for later.
3.  Deploy Smart Contracts: Deploy the smart contracts to the blockchain network using `Truffle migrate` after doing necessary configuration in **üìÅtruffle-config.js**.

### Client
1.  Install Dependencies: `npm install`.
2. Add environment variables and add below variables:

        REACT_APP_IPFS_API_KEY= your api key
        REACT_APP_IPFS_API_SECRET_KEY=your secret key
3. run `npm start`
